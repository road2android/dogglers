# Dogglers

## Introduction
This is the starter code for the Dogglers app project in the final pathway of Android Basics Unit 2. This project is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the concepts you learned in the unit.

## Behavior

- **When you launch the app, you're provided with options for horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts.**
- **The first option is a vertical scrolling recycler view with items that take up the full width of the screen.**
- **The second option shows the list of dogs in a horizontally scrolling recycler view.**
- **The third option shows the dogs in a vertically scrolling grid-style layout where two dogs are shown on each row.**
- **All of these layouts are powered by the same adapter class. Your task will be to build the layouts for the recycler view cards, and then implement the adapter so that each item is populated with the information about each dog.**
